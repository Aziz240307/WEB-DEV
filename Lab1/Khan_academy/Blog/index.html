        <p><small>January 23, 2026</small></p>
        <p class = "paragraphs">Based on the first lecture, day one in web development starts by understanding the fundamentals: a web application is software that runs on a web server and is accessed through a browser, requiring no installation. You’ll explore how the web works through the client-server model, where browsers send requests and servers return responses. The course introduces key roles: frontend (what users see, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (server logic, databases, and frameworks like Django or Node.js). You’ll also touch on core concepts like hosting, APIs, data formats like JSON, and modern development approaches such as REST and Agile methodology. It’s a structured dive into the building blocks of the web.</p>

        <p><small>January 24, 2026</small></p>
        <p class = "paragraphs"> 
Every website you see online is built with two essential technologies: HTML and CSS. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the "structure" of a webpage—defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds "tyle" and "ayout" controlling colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.  

Together, HTML and CSS form the foundation of frontend web development. Whether you’re creating a simple personal site or a complex web application, mastering these tools is your first step toward building beautiful, functional, and user-friendly experiences on the web.</p>
        <h3 id="blog3" class="h">What I Learned After My First Project</h3>
        <p><small>January 25, 2026</small></p>
<p class="paragraphs">Building this blog was my first hands-on step into web development. What came easily was defining the basic structure: splitting the page into "header", "main", and   "footer", and filling them with headings, paragraphs, and lists. What proved more challenging was working with CSS for styling. For the first time, I used properties like `text-align: center` to align headings and `font-style: italic` to style text. I learned how to apply IDs and classes for precise style control—for example, `#header` sets the header background, while `.paragraphs` gives a uniform look to all blog entries. The most valuable lesson was the importance of semantic markup and separating structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS). The project isn’t finished yet, but I can already feel theoretical knowledge turning into a real, working website.</p>
